# AG Charts — writing & debugging correct code

Where docs pages are provided below they are a slug, load the page from `https://www.ag-grid.com/charts/archive/{major.minor.patch}/{framework}/{slug}/` as described in documentation-index.md.

## Common mistakes

- AG Charts and AG Grid release in lockstep: charts major = grid major − 22 (e.g. charts 13.x ↔ grid 35.x). For grid charting features (integrated charts, sparklines) use the matching major/minor pair.
- The API object is `AgCharts` (plural), not `AgChart`: `import { AgCharts } from 'ag-charts-community'; const chart = AgCharts.create(options)`. There is no `AgChart.create` and no `AgEnterpriseCharts` export — both are older names still present in training data. In React the component is also `AgCharts`, imported from `ag-charts-react` (not the old `AgChartsReact`).
- Presets are NOT created with `AgCharts.create`: financial charts use `AgCharts.createFinancialChart(options)`, gauges use `AgCharts.createGauge(options)`. Passing preset options to `AgCharts.create()` is silently rejected — each option is logged as "Unknown option, ignoring" and the chart shows "No data to display".
- The chart container needs a height. With no explicit `width`/`height` option the chart fills its container element; an unsized container falls back to the `minWidth`/`minHeight` default of 300px and may mis-size. `container` must be an `HTMLElement`, not an id string. Docs: `layout`
- Data can be set once on the chart (`options.data`, shared by all series) or per-series (`series[].data`, overrides chart-level). Each series maps columns via keys — `xKey`/`yKey` (cartesian), `angleKey`/`calloutLabelKey` (pie/donut) — and a series with no matching keys renders nothing silently. Docs: `data-configuration`
- Updating data/options requires a NEW options object; in-place mutation does not update the chart. Use `AgChartInstance.update(options)` (full, returns a Promise), `updateDelta(partial)`, or `applyTransaction(...)` for incremental data — spread into a fresh object rather than re-passing the mutated one. Docs: `transactions`, `high-frequency-data`
  - `updateDelta` merges top-level properties but replaces `series`/`axes` array items wholesale by index — spread the original item before changing one field, or you drop its other options and it typically throws.
- Tooltip renderers return a structured object — `{ heading?, title?, data?: [{ label, value }] }` — not an HTML `content` string. The `content` field was removed in v13; returning it renders a blank tooltip. Docs: `tooltips`
- Community series are `bar`, `line`, `area`, `scatter`, `bubble`, `histogram`, `pie`, `donut`. Everything else (candlestick, heatmap, waterfall, radar/radial, sankey, treemap, sunburst, maps, gauges, org chart, …) is enterprise-only and requires `ag-charts-enterprise` plus a licence key. Docs: `community-vs-enterprise`
- Theme is a keyword string or an object, never `true`. Keywords: `ag-default`, `ag-sheets`, `ag-polychroma`, `ag-vivid`, `ag-material`, each with a `-dark` variant, plus `ag-financial`/`ag-financial-dark` for financial charts. Pass an object (`{ baseTheme, palette, overrides }`) to customise. Docs: `themes`
- The enterprise licence key API is `LicenseManager.setLicenseKey` from `ag-charts-enterprise`, not `AgCharts.setLicenseKey`. Call once at startup before creating charts. Docs: `license-install`

### Major version transitions

- Module registration is mandatory from v13: call `ModuleRegistry.registerModules([...])` before creating charts. When prototyping, register the everything-bundles (`AllCommunityModule`/`AllEnterpriseModule`) and leave a TODO to swap for fine-grained modules. Docs: `module-registry`
- From v13, `axes` is a dictionary keyed `x`/`y` (cartesian) or `angle`/`radius` (polar) — `axes: { x: { type: 'category' }, y: { type: 'number' } }` — not the old array form. Bind a series to a secondary axis with `yKeyAxis`/`xKeyAxis` (there is no `axes` object on a series). Docs: `axes-configuration`, `axes-types`
- Bar and column series merged: use `type: 'bar'` for both vertical and horizontal bars — the separate `type: 'column'` was removed. Docs: `bars`

## Performance (high-volume / high-frequency)

- Prefer a single root-level `data` array shared by all series over per-series `series[].data` — one shared dataset is much easier for AG Charts to optimise.
- Prefer the fastest update path that fits the change: `applyTransaction()` (incremental append/prepend/remove) is faster than `updateDelta()` (partial), which is faster than `update()` (full replacement). Docs: `high-frequency-data`, `transactions`
- Callbacks are expensive — `itemStyler` and `styler` especially. Avoid them on hot paths; when you must use one, pass a stable static function reference rather than a fresh inline closure, so results stay cached instead of invalidating on every update.
- For a custom `theme`, use a static, immutable object reference — a stable reference lets AG Charts cache the processed theme instead of reprocessing it each update. Docs: `themes`
- For time series, use numeric timestamps rather than `Date` objects (avoids round-tripping and memory churn), and prefer a continuous time axis over a non-continuous or category-based axis.

## Pay attention to console messages

AG Charts logs validation errors and warnings to the console. Where practical, include a real browser in the verification loop (e.g. Chrome MCP or Playwright) and watch for console messages — a misconfiguration causing an actual bug is often described there in detail.

## React

The component (`AgCharts` from `ag-charts-react`) takes a single object prop, `options`.

- Hold `options` in `useState` (or `useMemo`); a freshly-constructed object each render forces a full chart update. Update by replacing the object (e.g. `setChartOptions`), not by mutating it in place.
- When changing some keys within options, use the immutable update pattern popularised by Redux: preserve reference equality for keys that haven't changed.
